To speed things up dramatically, install their node backend. Visit https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node for more details:

Hey! To boost your TensorFlow.js performance in Node.js, you should switch from the browser-optimized `@tensorflow/tfjs` package to the Node.js-specific `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`. This change leverages native TensorFlow binaries, offering significant speed improvements...

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to take advantage of GPU acceleration, you can install the GPU version of the package:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu
```

Ensure that you have CUDA installed on your machine before using the GPU package.
